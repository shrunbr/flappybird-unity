### Credits
This is my recreation of Flappy Bird [originally created by Dong Nguyen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird).

This is the second game I "made" in Unity as part of [The 20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/).

Thanks to [Zigurous](https://github.com/zigurous) and [Adam Graham](https://github.com/adamgraham) for the Unity tutorials!
